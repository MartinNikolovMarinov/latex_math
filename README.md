# Repository purpose

This is a LaTeX development environment that uses the XeLaTeX compiler with `latexmk`. The project is filled with examples for quick reference when developing complicated LaTeX code. It is oriented towards writing mathematical equations and splitting large LaTeX files into subfiles.

Dependencies:

1. Only works on Linux.
2. Requires apt packages - `texlive-full`, `texlive-xetex`, `latexmk`, `biber`, `entr` and probably more.
